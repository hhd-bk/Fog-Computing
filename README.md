# Fog-Computing



1. Prepare
- Download images from google image using chromedriver.
- Train a small neural network to detect fire in image.
- Testing some functions for each node can find another node (find IP of each other by using MAC address).

2. Simulation on Oracle VM VirutalBox software.
- Set up 4 nodes (Unbuntu).
- Each can recognize another active nodes and find thier ip addresses.
- Each node can find and ask for detecting fire in the image. If the node received the request don't have ability to the job, it will send to other node.
